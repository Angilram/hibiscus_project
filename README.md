##MSc research on transcriptional regulation of development across Hibiscus species

Investigating the impact of speciation on genome organisation and gene expression using Hibiscus and Cotton species:

This project used genome data generated using 10x Chromium technology and RNAseq data corresponding to early stages of petal development.
I used an array of computational methods, including the development of new programs using Python as a primary language. 

Thanks to Joe Walker for his advice and custom Perl scripts (deposited here - full credit to Dr Walker).
