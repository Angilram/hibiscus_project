# Part_III_Project
Master's project on transcriptional regulation of development across Hibiscus species

Investigating the impact of speciation on genome organisation and gene expression using Hibiscus and Cotton species:

This project will take advantage of genome data generated using the 10x Chromium technology and RNAseq data corresponding to early stages of petal development.
The proposed project will use an array of computational methods, including the development of new programs using Python as a primary language. 

Thanks to Joe Walker for his advice and custom Perl scripts (deposited here - full credit to Dr Walker).
